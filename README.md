# PCT-GPS
Graph Traversal

Using given data (node #, coordinates, street names, direction) representing points in Williamsport, PA, a graph is created.
Within created graph, use either Dijkstra's or A* to find the shortest path through the graph given a start and end point.

Topics Covered:
Graph
Nodes
Edges
Directed Graph
Dijsktra's Algorithm
Object Oriented Design

Would love to upgrade:
- Use a GUI to choose start and end point +
- to display shortest path + distance in a better way.

- Find a way to use given item #, not read by specific lines
